# Lacona-Numi Plugin

This is a plugin that will allow me to integrate [Numi](https://numi.app) with the [Lacona](https://lacona.app) spotlight replacement.

Why not do this in Alfred, which is better-supported than Lacona? Because Lacona's included in Setapp.

(Numi ships with an Alfred plugin so I assume it exposes an API I can hook into with Lacona instead.)
